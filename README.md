## Printing your CruxStryke cage

Print your cage from PLA, PETG, ABS or your preferred 3D printing material.<br>
0.2mm or similar layer height with 4 or more perimeters and 30%+ infill.<br>
Use support under the three cage mount holes. Support avoidance on the rest of the cage is suggested but optional.<br>
Drill cage mount holes and motor mount holes with 3mm bit. Use original cage screws to mount cage.<br>
File or sand any rough/drooping areas inside the dart guides especially the upper sections.<br>
See FDL-3 flywheel instructions for printing your flywheels.<br>
Attach flywheels to motors with M2.5x5 flathead screws.<br>
Mount motors to cage with M3x8 socket head screws.<br>
Use thread locker on both flywheel and motor screws.<br>


## Shell mods

Remove dart guides/rails from shell above cage with Dremel or other tool. All other shell mods including battery tray clearing are optional and done at your own discression.

## Electronics

You're on your own past the motors and ESC's. I used an FDL-3 power board and soldered wires directly to an Arduino Pro Mini in mine with a slightly altered FDL-3 semi firmware. There are lots of options and methods out there to spin brushless motors. Be creative;)

### Make on!
